How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
what a stupid question...  It helped as it printed out the lines that were changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
learn from mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
cons potential user error or forgetting to use, pros are automatic save may save at illogical points and code may not compile, also not necessarily at useful points

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
for use in programming or other systems where multiple files are being used within a project to be compiled 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows a lof of all changes along with IDs timestamps author and comment/description.  git diff [firstID] [secondID] shows the changes between two commits with insertions and deletions in green/red respectively

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can always go back to a point when it worked and find out what point you broke it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
learning to do commits
